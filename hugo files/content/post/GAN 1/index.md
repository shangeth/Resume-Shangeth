# [GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) are ML models that can imagine new things.

GANs can generate new data with a given dataset by learning its distribution. GANs have been mostly used with image datas but can also be used on any kind of data. GANs draw a sample from the learned probability distribution of the dataset which is a completely new sample.\\

GANs are [unsupervised machine learning models](https://shangeth.github.io/post/unsupervised-learning/) , which learns the distribution of the data through adverserial process and generate new sample from the learned distribution.

# Some Recent Research in GAN


- ## [Stack GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03242)

	Stack GAN can take a discription of an image and can genration new images matching that discription. GAN picks a sample from a distribution of iamges which match the description.

- ## [iGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03552.pdf)

	iGANs can search for realistic possible image as the user draws the rough sketch.\\

- ## [Pix2Pix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004)
	Images in one domain can be changed to image in another domain with GANS. Rough sketches can be made into a realistic image which are generated by GANs. Blue Prints of a building can be changed to an image of finished building with GANs.

- Many other applications like photos to cartoons, daylight image to night scene image, [Cycle GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593).



In the next few posts, we will look deep into how GANs work and code GANs with PyTorch for different applications.
